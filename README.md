# Basic Robot Behaviour
Basic Robot Behaviour for Robotics Module at The University of Lincoln.   
Written in Python for ROS to be run on a Turtlebot.

The Turtlebot will explore until it sees the colour green.
The Turtlebot will then approtch the green object and will decrease in speed the closer it gets.
Unless the overall brightness of the image is reduced pass a threshold indicating darkness where the Turtlebot is.
In this case the Turtlebot will then avoid the colour green.
